# Calculator

This project is an implementation of a simple calculator. It is the result of studying how to use the WindowBuilder Pro GUI Designer tool. There are several issues that need to be resolved:

1. I honestly do not know if it is important to implement the Simgleton design pattern for this project. I know that for a desktop clock it does not make sense to have two on the screen: but two calculators might be interesting. I figured to implement the pattern perhaps to prevent the user from opening dozens of calculators at the same time;

2. I have not yet implemented the use of typing keys on the calculator. Many people prefer to type on the keyboard than clicking on the virtual keys on the calculator. But I still do not understand how to do this in Java;

3. The user can still click on the display and enter letters and special characters. This can not happen in a professional design of a calculator. It's a serious problem to be recaptured.

Overall, I was testing the code using a real calculator for comparison and it looks like everything was in order. But we can say that it is a beta: we did not use this calculator for important calculations yet.
