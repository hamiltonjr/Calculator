# Calculator

This project is an implementation of a simple calculator. It is the result of studying how to use the WindowBuilder Pro GUI Designer tool. The project was again developed from scratch to implement best practices of object-orientation and facilities for customization. All errors previously reported as issues to be resolved have been deleted, except that it is still not possible to type directly on the computer keyboard to perform calculations.

Now the project allows for customization. For example, it is easy to increase a line in the layout and include some keys with extra functions.

The calculator is simple, but it was designed to mimic the best possible real calculator.
